# LAPR1 Project

## Description

This project implements, in Java, algorithms for image compression and reconstruction using eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition (PCA/Eigenfaces). It allows working with image matrices in CSV format, performing compression, reconstruction, and error analysis, as well as generating reconstructed images.

## Project Structure

- `LAPR1_Project/`
  - `src/src/lapr1_24_25_DKL_01.java`: Main file containing all project logic.
  - `ImagensTestes/`: Contains test images in `.csv` (matrix) and `.png` (original image) formats.
  - `META-INF/`: Project metadata.
  - `out/`: Compilation output (may be generated by the IDE).
  - `src/src/`: Java source code.

## Features

- Compression of image matrices using eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
- Reconstruction of images from a chosen number K of eigenfaces.
- Calculation of absolute error between original and reconstructed images.
- Generation of output files with matrices and reconstructed images.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Java 8 or higher
   - Apache Commons Math3 library (for matrix operations)

2. **Compile:**
   ```bash
   javac -cp .:commons-math3-3.6.1.jar LAPR1_Project/src/src/lapr1_24_25_DKL_01.java
   ```

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   java -cp .:commons-math3-3.6.1.jar LAPR1_Project/src/src/lapr1_24_25_DKL_01
   ```

4. **Usage Modes:**
   - **Interactive:** Without arguments, presents menus for compression, reconstruction, and image analysis.
   - **Non-interactive:** Can receive arguments for automatic processing (see code for argument details).

## Usage Examples

- Compressing an image matrix:
  1. Choose option 1 in the menu.
  2. Provide the path to a square and symmetrical CSV matrix file.
  3. The programme generates output files in the `Output/` folder.

- Reconstructing images with eigenfaces:
  1. Choose option 2 or 3 in the menu.
  2. Provide the folder with CSV images and the number of eigenfaces (K).
  3. The programme generates matrices and reconstructed images in the `Eigenfaces/` and `ImagensReconstruidas/` folders.

## Dependencies

- [Apache Commons Math3](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/):
  - Add the JAR file to the classpath to compile and run.
